# Aman Jaglan

**Co-Founder & CTO at [Marshmallo AI](https://marshmallo.ai)**

Building infrastructure for AI agents that learn continuously from production.

## Current

At Marshmallo, building the **Continual Agentic Learning Platform** — agents that observe, evaluate, learn, and deploy in a closed loop. Compounding intelligence over time, not static after deployment.

## Previous — Arc Computer

Built [ATLAS](https://github.com/arc-computer/ATLAS) (Adaptive Teaching and Learning Alignment System), an open-source continual learning framework for production LLM agents.

**What I built:**

- **Reinforced Continual Learning (RCL)**: Teacher-Student framework where Teacher models generate thinking traces to guide Student agents. Cross-domain transfer without domain-specific fine-tuning.

- **Cross-Domain Learning**: Teacher trained on mathematics (46% on AIME-25), transfers reasoning to enterprise tasks like CRM policy compliance.

- **Inference-Time Continual Learning**: 54.1% task success vs GPT-5 High's 48.0% at 86% lower cost. Gradient-free, runtime adaptation.

- **On-Policy Distillation**: 10x more compute-efficient than RL. Two-gear training pattern for production-ready continual learning.

- **[Atlas SDK](https://github.com/arc-computer/atlas-sdk)**: Runtime wrapper capturing causality traces from agent workflows. Enables offline training via GRPO and GKD.

**Results**: +15.7% accuracy, +31% task completion, 97% non-degradation rate.
