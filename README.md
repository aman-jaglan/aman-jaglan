> Building the feedback loop that makes AI agents learn from production. Agents should get smarter from every failure, not repeat the same mistakes.

## Current -- Marshmallo AI

Building **[Marlo](https://github.com/Marshmallo-AI/Marlo)**, the open-source agent learning platform. Capture behavior, evaluate outcomes, and turn failures into learnings that deploy back into the agent. Intelligence compounds over time.

- **[Marlo SDK](https://pypi.org/project/marlo-sdk/)** -- Python & TypeScript SDKs for capturing agent traces, tool calls, and reasoning
- **[Marlo Inbox](https://github.com/Marshmallo-AI/marlo-inbox)** -- AI email & calendar assistant powered by Marlo
- **[Marlo Docs](https://github.com/Marshmallo-AI/docs)** -- Documentation for the platform

## Research

**[Continual Learning, Not Training: Online Adaptation For Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01093)**

ATLAS achieves 54.1% success with GPT-5-mini as Student, outperforming GPT-5 (High) by 13% while reducing cost by 86%. Cross-validation improves accuracy from 28% to 41% without retraining.

## Previous -- Arc Computer

Built the open-source continual learning stack for production LLM agents.

- **[ATLAS](https://github.com/arc-computer/ATLAS)** -- Continual learning framework. Teacher-Student architecture with cross-domain transfer and inference-time adaptation. +15.7% accuracy, +31% task completion, 97% non-degradation rate.
- **[Atlas SDK](https://github.com/arc-computer/atlas-sdk)** -- Runtime wrapper capturing causality traces. Enables offline training via GRPO and GKD.
- **[CL-Bench](https://github.com/arc-computer/CL-Bench)** -- Benchmark for evaluating agent continual learning in stateful environments. Production-realistic CRM workflows with multi-turn conversations and state mutations.
- **[HuggingFace Models](https://huggingface.co/arc-intelligence)** -- Open weights for continual learning research.

---

## Side Projects

- **[OpenSearch](https://github.com/aman-jaglan/opensearch)** -- AI research engine that searches, analyzes, and generates cited reports with charts(Better Perplexity)
- **[ReplicaDB](https://github.com/aman-jaglan/ReplicaDB)** -- Single platform for data and analytics needs
- **[CI Code Companion](https://github.com/aman-jaglan/CI-Code-Companion)** -- AI-powered GitLab CI/CD tool using Vertex AI for auto-generating tests, docs, and pipeline templates
